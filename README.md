# React-Redux-Boilerplate

An opinionated template for creating web applications with React and Redux.

## Background

Here are a curated and annotated list of sources explaining both how to use the technologies in this template and why I chose them. Additionally, I have included my own thoughts when necessary. I consider this to be the minimum subset of reading necessary to understand all the technologies. Feel free to make a pull request or fork this repository if you disagree.

### Terminology
- JavaScript == ECMAScript
- ECMAScript 2015 == ES2015 == ECMAScript 6 == ES6
- SASS and LESS are two preprocessors for CSS. They help you write better CSS code. [Read this for more information.](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/sass-vs-less/)
- SASS is the successor to SCSS
- CommonJS vs AMD vs ES2015 Modules - several competing systems for creating reusable modules of JavaScript code. 

### Modules
- Modules provide you with the ability to encapsulate and reuse your code. Unlike almost any other programming language you've ever used, JavaScript does not provide a simple way to create isolated blocks of code in separate files and reuse them across your project. There have been many attempts to add this functionality to JavaScript. [This site provides a good overview of the different module systems available](https://auth0.com/blog/javascript-module-systems-showdown/).
- While AMD may seem like the superior option
